## Running the Streamlit App 

The Streamlit is under development — only a basic placeholder is available for now.

To run the Streamlit dashboard locally, follow these steps:

Open Anaconda Navigator
Launch Anaconda and open VSCode from within Anaconda.

Navigate to the Streamlit Folder
In VSCode, open a terminal and make sure you're in the Streamlit directory of the project.

Install Required Packages
In the terminal, run the following command to install all necessary packages:

pip install streamlit

Once dependencies are installed, launch the app with:

streamlit run pages/main.py

This will open a local Streamlit web app in your browser.
You can also run these commands in any other terminal (e.g. Windows Terminal, macOS Terminal) as long as your Python environment is activated.
